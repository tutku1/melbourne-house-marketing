# Machine Learning Project: Regression and Tree-Based Methods

## Overview

Welcome to my Machine Learning project! This project focuses on analyzing a dataset related to housing prices in Melbourne. Melbourne is the capital and largest city of the Australian state of Victoria, and it ranks as the second-most populous city in both Australia and Oceania. The dataset contains various attributes of houses in Melbourne along with their corresponding prices. Through this project, we aim to explore patterns, relationships, and factors influencing housing prices in Melbourne using regression and tree-based machine learning methods.

## Project Objectives
Problem Solving: I addressed multiple issues utilizing regression and tree-based methods.
Model Evaluation: I meticulously assessed the performance of the models generated.
Portfolio Enhancement: This project serves as a significant asset in my portfolio, demonstrating proficiency in Machine Learning.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

Data Examination: Extensive exploration of the dataset to comprehend its characteristics and potential challenges.
Data Preparation: Preprocessing steps like handling missing values and encoding categorical variables were undertaken.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilized visualizations and statistical techniques to gain insights into the data.
Model Building: Utilized regression and tree-based models to solve the specified problems.
Model Evaluation: Performance evaluation of each model using suitable metrics and techniques.
Conclusion: A summary of findings and implications of the results.
