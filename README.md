# Machine Learning Project: Regression and Tree-Based Methods

## Overview

Welcome to my Machine Learning project! In this project, I tackled various problems using regression and tree-based methods. The primary goal was to evaluate the effectiveness of traditional Machine Learning techniques in solving real-world problems. Through this project, I delved into data examination, data preparation, exploratory data analysis, and model evaluation.

## Project Objectives
Problem Solving: I aimed to solve multiple problems using regression and tree-based methods.
Model Evaluation: I evaluated the performance of the models generated by these methods.
Portfolio Enhancement: This project serves as a valuable addition to my portfolio, showcasing my expertise in Machine Learning.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

Data Examination: I thoroughly examined the dataset to understand its characteristics, distributions, and potential challenges.
Data Preparation: I preprocessed the data, handled missing values, and encoded categorical variables to prepare it for model training.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using visualizations and statistical techniques, I explored relationships between variables and gained insights into the data.
Model Building: I constructed regression and tree-based models to solve the specified problems.
Model Evaluation: I evaluated the performance of each model using appropriate metrics and techniques.
Conclusion: Finally, I summarized the findings and discussed the implications of the results.
